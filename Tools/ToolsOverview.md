## Introduction

Cybersecurity tools help automate security tasks, detect anomalies, and mitigate cyber threats. This repository will focus on developing and curating tools for **blue team operations**, including:

- **Threat detection and intelligence**
- **Incident response and forensics**
- **Network security analysis**
- **Log correlation and SIEM integrations**
- **Malware analysis and reverse engineering**

This document will be continuously updated as new tools are added.

## Planned Tools

Below are some categories of tools that will be developed in this repository:

1. **Network Traffic Monitoring Tools** - Tools to analyze packet flows, detect anomalies, and identify malicious traffic.
2. **Endpoint Security Solutions** - Scripts and frameworks for monitoring and protecting endpoints from threats.
3. **Log Analysis & SIEM Integrations** - Tools for processing and correlating logs across various sources.
4. **Threat Hunting & Intelligence Gathering** - Solutions to automate IoC (Indicators of Compromise) lookups and adversary tracking.
5. **Malware Sandboxing & Reverse Engineering** - Environments and utilities for safely analyzing malware behavior.

## Example Tools

### Threat Detection and Analysis: NetSec Analyzer

**NetSec Analyzer** is a planned tool for **network security analysis and threat detection**. It will include:

- **Packet inspection and anomaly detection** using AI-based behavioral analysis.
- **Automated correlation of network events** to detect lateral movement and exfiltration.
- **Integration with threat intelligence feeds** to identify known bad actors.

This tool aims to enhance **real-time monitoring** and **early threat detection** for SOC (Security Operations Center) teams.

### Incident Response and Forensics: BlueShield IR

**BlueShield IR** will be a **lightweight incident response framework** for cybersecurity professionals. Features will include:

- **Automated collection of system artifacts** (logs, processes, network activity, memory dumps).
- **Detection of persistence mechanisms** used by adversaries.
- **Integration with MITRE ATT&CK** to map detected techniques to known threat actor behaviors.
- **Forensic timeline reconstruction** to aid in post-breach investigations.

The goal is to **streamline incident response** while reducing manual forensic efforts.
