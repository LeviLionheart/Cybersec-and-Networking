## Understanding Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence (TI) involves the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about threats and adversaries to help organizations make informed security decisions. Effective threat intelligence should be:
- **Relevant**: Aligns with the organization’s threat landscape.
- **Usable**: Provides actionable insights to mitigate risks.
- **Timely**: Ensures threats are addressed before they cause harm.

## Types of Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence is categorized into three main types:

### 1. Strategic Intelligence
- High-level reports for executives & decision-makers.
- Provides geopolitical and industry-wide threat trends.
- **Examples**: Whitepapers from CISA, MITRE, and government agencies  
  *Source: [CISA.gov](https://www.cisa.gov)*

### 2. Tactical Intelligence
- Focuses on adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
- Based on frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.
- Helps security teams understand attack patterns.

### 3. Operational Intelligence
- Includes real-time threat indicators, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and malware hashes.
- Shared via threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) and automated feeds.

## Threat Intelligence Feeds & Platforms
Organizations use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) feeds to automate threat detection and integrate intelligence into their security stack. Key sources include:

- **CISA Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Government-backed intelligence feeds with known IoCs and threat actor profiles  
  *Source: [CISA.gov](https://www.cisa.gov)*
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: A globally recognized framework mapping adversary TTPs  
  *Source: [CISA.gov](https://www.cisa.gov)*
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Tools**: Tools like Shodan, VirusTotal, and Maltego for data enrichment.
- **Commercial Threat Intelligence Services**: Providers like Recorded Future, FireEye, and CrowdStrike offer curated intelligence.

## Operationalizing Threat Intelligence
To effectively use threat intelligence, organizations should:

- **Integrate Intelligence into SIEM & SOAR**
  - Automate correlation of IoCs in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
  - Use Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) for real-time responses.

- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**
  - Join ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) for industry-specific intelligence.
  - Participate in government-backed CTI-sharing programs (e.g., CISA Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)).

- **Adopt Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**
  - Centralize intelligence from multiple sources to improve visibility and response.

## Threat Hunting Methodologies
Threat hunting proactively identifies hidden threats within an environment. Key methodologies include:

- **Hypothesis-Driven Hunting**: Security teams create hypotheses based on known adversary TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK).
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Uses machine learning to identify deviations in user and network behavior.
- **IOC-Based Hunting**: Searches for known malware signatures, IP addresses, and hashes from threat feeds.

## Best Practices & Frameworks
- **Follow MITRE ATT&CK & D3FEND Frameworks**: Utilize ATT&CK for adversary profiling and D3FEND for defensive strategies.
- **Leverage CISA’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Framework**: Align threat intelligence operations with government guidelines.

- **Implement NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Align threat intelligence with risk management best practices.
