## Zero Trust & Access Control

### Implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
_While many end users hate it.. and threat actors have demostrated it's flaws, it is still regarded as best practice for organizations to follow._

- **Never trust, always verify**: Enforce continuous authentication and verification of all users and devices.
- **Micro-segmentation**: Limit access between different network segments to reduce lateral movement.
- **Context-aware access controls**: Use behavior analytics to detect anomalies in user activity.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
_Another end user favorite.. which I don't understand as a user of MFA in my personal life.._

- Enforce **phishing-resistant MFA** (e.g., hardware security keys, FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication).
- Implement **conditional access policies** that adapt based on user risk profiles.

## Network Security & Segmentation
_Most organization on a large scale will leave this sort of stuff to the networking team, however it is important to recognize as a security professional, and some places you may find yourself managing both_

### Advanced Network Segmentation
- Use **micro-segmentation** to isolate sensitive workloads and reduce the attack surface.
- Implement **network access control (NAC)** to enforce least privilege access.

### AI-Driven Threat Detection
- Deploy **AI-powered network monitoring** for real-time anomaly detection and automatic response.
- Utilize **intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)** enhanced with AI to identify complex threats.

## Endpoint Security & AI-Driven Defense

### System Hardening & EDR
- Apply **strict least privilege** for users and system processes.
- Deploy **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions** with AI-driven behavior analysis.
- Utilize **application control and allow-listing** to block unauthorized software.

### AI-Powered Malware Protection
- Adopt **next-gen antivirus (NGAV)** solutions that use machine learning to detect zero-day threats.
- Implement **real-time behavior analysis** to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs).

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### Modernized SIEM & Threat Intelligence
- Integrate **threat intelligence feeds** into SIEM for proactive detection of emerging threats.
- Utilize **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** to streamline threat mitigation.

## Cloud Security & SASE

### Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
- Implement **single-vendor SASE solutions** for secure remote access with minimal latency.
- Ensure **cloud-based Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** for all users, devices, and workloads.

### Data Protection & Encryption
- Use **end-to-end encryption** for data in transit and at rest.
- Deploy **AI-driven Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions** to prevent unauthorized data access.

## Incident Detection & Response

### Threat Hunting & Automated Response
- Conduct **continuous threat hunting** using MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Utilize **automated response playbooks** in SOAR platforms to mitigate threats in real-time.

### AI-Specific Threat Mitigation
- Protect against **adversarial AI attacks** targeting AI-driven applications.
- Implement **AI security posture management** to monitor AI models and prevent data leaks.
