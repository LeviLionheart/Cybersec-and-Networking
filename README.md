# Cybersec-and-Networking

A repository containing guides, frameworks, and tools for individuals working in cybersecurity and networking, with a primary focus on blue team operations. While our main emphasis is on defensive strategies, we also include resources where blue team practices intersect with pentesting and ethical hacking. Plus, ethical hacking is a fun way to tinker and explore how exploits are used against organizations.
