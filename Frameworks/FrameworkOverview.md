## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)

Developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, the CSF provides a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity. It consists of five core functions:

- **Identify**: Asset management, business environment, governance
- **Protect**: Access controls, security awareness, data protection
- **Detect**: Continuous monitoring, anomaly detection
- **Respond**: Incident response planning, mitigation strategies
- **Recover**: Disaster recovery, resilience improvements

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The **MITRE ATT&CK** framework is a globally accessible knowledge base of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber adversaries. It is widely adopted for:

- Threat intelligence and detection
- Adversary emulation
- Security operations and red teaming

## CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS v8)

The **CIS Controls** provide a prioritized set of security actions to protect organizations from cyber threats. Version 8 aligns with modern technologies such as cloud and mobile security. Key control categories:

- **Basic**: Foundational cybersecurity measures
- **Foundational**: Advanced security configurations
- **Organizational**: Governance and risk management

## ISO/IEC 27001

The **ISO/IEC 27001** framework is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It focuses on:

- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Security policies and controls
- Compliance and continuous improvement

## Cyber Kill Chain

Developed by **Lockheed Martin**, the Cyber Kill Chain outlines the stages of a cyberattack and provides guidance on defense strategies:

1. **Reconnaissance** â€“ Gathering target information
2. **Weaponization** â€“ Creating attack tools
3. **Delivery** â€“ Transmitting the attack to the target
4. **Exploitation** â€“ Gaining access through vulnerabilities
5. **Installation** â€“ Deploying malicious software
6. **Command and Control (C2)** â€“ Establishing remote access
7. **Actions on Objectives** â€“ Executing the attack

## NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The **NIST RMF** provides a structured approach to risk management, widely used by U.S. government agencies:

- Categorize: Define impact levels
- Select: Choose security controls
- Implement: Deploy controls
- Assess: Evaluate effectiveness
- Authorize: Approve risk acceptance
- Monitor: Continuously assess security posture

## Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

**Zero Trust** is a security model that assumes no entityâ€”inside or outside the networkâ€”should be trusted by default. Key principles:

- **Least privilege access** â€“ Minimize user permissions
- **Micro-segmentation** â€“ Isolate sensitive resources
- **Continuous verification** â€“ Authenticate all activity

---

## COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)

**COBIT** is a governance framework for managing and optimizing IT security and compliance. It focuses on:

- Risk-based decision-making
- Alignment of IT goals with business objectives
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
